### Deprecation of react-tools
The react-tools package and JSXTransformer.js browser file have been deprecated. You can continue using version 0.13.3 of both, but we no longer support them and recommend migrating to Babel, which has built-in support for React and JSX. [see here](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html#deprecation-of-react-tools)
